## The Building Blocks of Biological Intelligence
Neurons are cells in the nervous system that form the building blocks of biological intelligence. They communicate with one another by  receiving, processing, and transmitting electrical pulses (called spikes) to and from other neurons and organs in the body. These signals help people think, feel, and react to the world around them.

**1. Dendrite Receives Signal**: Electrical pulses (spikes) enter a neuron through dendrites (TODO: Make figure).

**2. Charge Aggregated**: Charge is then aggregated in the cell body (TODO: Make figure).

**3. Threshold Reached**: When a threshold is reached (at the axon hillock), an electrical pulse travels down the axon (called an “action potential”) (TODO: Make figure).

**4. Signal passed onto connected neurons**: The charge is then passed to connected neurons through small gaps called synapses (TODO: Make figure).

## Neural Circuits
Neurons connect to other neurons and organs in organized ways form different kinds of neural circuits. Different neural circuits perform different kinds of tasks (e.g., seeing, moving, remembering, solving problems). For instance, the cerebellar circuit (pictured right) plays a key role in coordination and movement, and helps with learning, prediction, and adapting to new situations. It is also the inspiration for the research highlighted on this site.
