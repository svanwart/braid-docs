## Applications and Implications
### Anomaly Detection (Robotics, Cybersecurity, & Medical Devices)

**Transparency and Explainability**
* *The Data*: What is collected, how is it stored, where is it transmitted, how long is it kept?
* *The Algorithm*: What can the software do, and what can it not do? What kinds of false attributions of human agency can be made?

**Bias**
* How are normal baselines established? 
  * If representative training data are not present, is this a problem?
  * How often is "outlier" activity no big deal (false positives)?
* Model drift: when is it OK, when is it not OK?
* How our outliers verified? Or is there full automation?
