## Introduction
This brief examines the ethical, legal, and societal implications (ELSI) of ongoing research on a novel electronic device, referred to in this document as a cerebellum-inspired circuit (CIC). The design of this circuit takes inspiration from the cerebellum, a region of the brain known for motor control, motor learning, and error correction (cite). Just as the cerebellum can quickly and efficiently detect, respond to, and learn from unexpected sensory input (cite), cerebellum-inspired circuits are designed to adapt to novel events in real time, enabling rapid anomaly detection and response. 

CICs are expected to offer significant value in domains where rapid error detection and correction are critical, such as identifying medical anomalies in healthcare, detecting road hazards in autonomous vehicles, enabling real-time movement adjustments in robotics, and flagging fraud or network intrusions in cybersecurity. That said, because these devices can classify data and identify outliers in real time, potentially faster and more efficiently than current state-of-the-art systems, there are certain risks that can arise from this technology concerning privacy, surveillance, autonomy, bias, and accountability. Since these concerns extend beyond CICs and are shared by many data-intensive, computer-mediated systems, our discussion of CICsâ€™ specific potential benefits and risks is framed within the broader context of the AI landscape.
