This site was created as both an educational tool and a critical intervention.
While it introduces core concepts in neuromorphic computing - such as event-driven processing, spiking neurons, and memristor-based architectures - it also aims to surface the assumptions, metaphors, and design choices embedded in this emerging paradigm.

By demystifying how neuromorphic systems function and inviting reflection on their implications, the site supports broader ELSI (Ethical, Legal, and Societal Implications) analysis. It is intended not just for students or technical audiences, but also as a way to foster interdisciplinary dialogue about the future of AI hardware and its governance.

## Basic Structure of the Website

### 1. Introduction
* Why neuromorphic computing matters now.
* Technical excitement + ethical uncertainty.
* Motivation: Need for accessible, critical educational tools.

### 2. Design Rationale
* Why this site was built.
* Choices around interactivity, metaphor, simplification.
* Audience: Technologists, students, interdisciplinary researchers.

### 3. Core Educational Content
* What the site teaches (spikes, event-driven logic, memristors, etc.).
* Design metaphors used (e.g. “neurons,” “energy-efficient,” “brain-like”).

### 4. Embedded Ethical Prompts
Where and how the site introduces ethical reflection:

* "What kinds of decisions should be made by event-driven systems?"
* "What does it mean to call a system 'brain-like'?"
* "Who benefits from the energy savings of neuromorphic designs — and who doesn’t?"

### 5. Analysis: ELSI Themes in Neuromorphic Tech
Potential themes to highlight:

* Explainability & traceability in spiking systems
* Cognitive metaphors and public perception (e.g. “brain-inspired” ≠ “brain-equivalent”)
* Data provenance in continual learning systems
* Hardware-driven bias or inaccessibility (e.g. favoring certain tasks, excluding others)
* Dual-use concerns (e.g. military, surveillance)

### 6. Use as a facilitation tool
How the site could be used in stakeholder interviews, public workshops, or classrooms.

* Notes on reception or preliminary feedback (if any).
* Plans for participatory design or co-evaluation.
