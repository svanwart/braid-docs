## 1. What is Artificial Intelligence?
Artificial Intelligence, as defined by Britannica and US Department of Defense, is classified as the ability of a digital computer (or robot)
to perform intelligent tasks. Aspects of this intelligence include the ability to learn, percieve, adapt to new circumstances, to reason, communicate, and more. Likewise, Google describes AI intelligence as having the ability to translate languages, analyze data, and make recommendations.

Deep Blue, the chess computer that beat Garry Kasparov (one of if not the greatest chess player of all time), is widely considered to be a form of AI. Google considers its search engine a form of AI. ChatGPT, as a large language model, is also a form of AI. The concept of "Artificual Intelligence" is broad, defined by the ability to accomplish a variety of complex tasks. AI has been a topic of scientific development since the 1970s and has been successfully been applied to real world problems since then.

AI is deeply connected to statistics, big data, computer science, neurology, mathematics, linguistics, and more.
