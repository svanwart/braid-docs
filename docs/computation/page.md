## 1. Introduction
* Layman's description of a Von Neumann Architecture
Von Neumann Architecture is a form of computer system constructed with a central processing unit (CPU) and memory unit. The CPU is the logic center that processes instructions and data whilst the memory unit is a storage area for the CPU to read and write from. Execution of instructions in the CPU are done instruction by instruction in sequential order.  

This form of computer architecture, pioneered by John von Neumann in 1945, is used in nearly all computers in the 21st century (as of 2025). Computers that are designed using Von Neumann Architecture include the supercomputer IBM Blue Gene, graphics cards produced by NVIDIA, and the device you are using to view this website.

Von Neumann Architecture can be explored further in detail below:
* The Central Processing Unit (CPU)
The CPU is itself broken down into two core components: The Control Unit (CU) and the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU).
- The CU is the instruction reader. When the CPU recieves instructions from the memory unit, the CU interprets those instructions and follows them in a sequential order. 
- The ALU is the logic and arhithmetic center. When instructions are passed to the ALU, the ALU makes changes to the memory to reflect processed data.
