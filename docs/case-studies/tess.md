## 1. Data Centers
*Written by Tess Carter, August 2024*

### Summary
Data centers are essentially giant warehouses that contain servers that house massive amounts of data and applications from all over the internet, including data from apps like Instagram or Facebook, or even the data from Google applications (gmail, google searches, etc). These servers process tons of data daily, storing and connecting it back to our devices, providing the memory we expect from our tech [[1]](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/11/uruguay-drought-water-google-data-center). This is "the Cloud" we think of when we backup our iphone storage, essential to our continued use of the internet. 

AI needs a lot of data to train itself on, which means it needs a lot of storage and a lot of energy to power itself, which data centers will have to provide by multiplying. All this energy being used for online applications in data centers ends up accounting for more than 1% of global electricity use, and because so much electricity is being used it produces a massive amount of heat waste which needs to be dealt with or else the servers will shut down. 

This means that data centers are also using an incredible amount of water on-site to cool servers, off-site for electricity generation, and for server and chip manufacturing. Just for Google data centers in 2022, 25 billion liters were withdrawn and 20 billion consumed for on site cooling, a 20% increase from the previous year likely because of AI [[4]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.03271). This water consumption is problematic when the water must be clean, fresh water, often taken directly from a population's drinkable water source, because the servers within the warehouses are sensitive to acidity and mineral buildup. 

To illustrate the advantages and disadvantages of datacenter locations, we're looking at a specific case in Uruguay, in the Department of Canelones, where Google wants to build a datacenter to power their non-AI specific operations. Google likely wants to settle the data center in this location because these 74 acres within the Parque de las Ciencias have tax exemptions for corporations. Uruguay however is experiencing its worst drought in the last 74 years which has grown so dire that salt water is being mixed into the public drinking water supply and at-risk groups like pregnant people, young children, and ill people are being told not to drink it. Plastic water bottles are being provided, but not at adequate levels for all communities, and a lot of the freshwater is still being directed to agricultural industries. 

A lot more water would be diverted towards this new data center that would use 560 GWh per year – the same as 202,898 households – and would guzzle down 46 million gallons of water daily – equivalent to 55,000 people. Google has paused the plans for now after massive protests to try and make the datacenter sustainable and less of a resource-guzzler [[1]](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/11/uruguay-drought-water-google-data-center).      

### Benefits

Data centers are critical for internet operations which a majority of the world relies on at this point (being able to email, zoom, share data, and store data are completely necessary to almost every industry now), so data centers keep these operations running and allow for more and more data to be stored, expanding tech capabilities and accessible knowledge. The datacenter in Uruguay specifically could open up a new industry and more job opportunities for the area. The increased demand for data centers and more power could push companies to devise more energy efficient designs for their tech and data centers, and place them in more strategic locations (not in drought heavy areas hopefully).  

### Harms 
* As already illustrated, data Centers take in a lot of water which isn't ideal in a time where water scarcity is growing alongside climate change. Some water may be reprocessed, but a lot is lost through evaporation, and companies don't typically include water usage in their AI model cards as they do for carbon emissions, which can make getting exact numbers difficult [[4]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.03271).  
* Goldman Sachs research has found that power demand from data centers will increase by 160% by 2030, and this increased demand will also increase carbon dioxide emissions, perhaps doubling between 2022 and 2030\. They also claim that AI specifically will account for 19% of the tidal data center power demand. In the US, energy demand is already on the up and up again, likely forcing the US to open a new pipeline for natural gas or looking to more industries to produce more power [[6]](https://www.goldmansachs.com/intelligence/pages/AI-poised-to-drive-160-increase-in-power-demand.html). Vox research says on AI energy usage that "training a large language model like OpenAI's GPT-3, for example, [uses](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.02001.pdf) nearly 1,300 megawatt-hours (MWh) of electricity, the annual consumption of about [130 US homes](https://www.theverge.com/24066646/ai-electricity-energy-watts-generative-consumption)"', and a classic google request takes only 0.3 watts-hour while ChatGPT takes 2.9 watts-hour, a marked increase given ChatGPT is often times promoted as an alternative to google search [[5]](https://www.vox.com/climate/2024/3/28/24111721/ai-uses-a-lot-of-energy-experts-expect-it-to-double-in-just-a-few-years).   
* In Uruguay specifically, and for many other data centers, the emergency power generators use coal to produce power, so that adds to carbon emissions. Datacenters in general still depend on fossil fuels despite newer tech claiming they're moving towards renewable sources and leading the "energy transition".   
* More data centers are being created to support the data-heavy, energy-sucking AI boom, which would ultimately lead to more water waste.   
* Theoretically data centers could be labeled critical infrastructure and thus land and water rights could be taken to support them instead of listening to the protests of the surrounding community. Critical infrastructure has a tendency to be built in cheap areas and to push out the residents of these poorer areas        

### Who benefits?
All tech companies are dependent on data center operations, and almost all industries rely on the storage and processing capabilities of the centers. People who use the internet benefit from having the apps and programs that depend on these capabilities for business and entertainment purposes alike. "The Cloud" is where a lot of precious data is saved long-term.  

### Who is harmed?

Water will be siphoned off from people who need it, so neighborhoods close to datacenters suffer the most. Data centers pop up where the land is cheap, there are tax exemptions, or there is existing power infrastructure to support the amount of energy needed to power datacenters, so it could be that marginalized neighborhoods would be hurt by this the most (as these neighborhoods have historically been redlined, their land devalued, and have had waste siphoned in from industrial districts).   

### Stakeholders — Direct and Indirect

We all use the internet, whether directly or indirectly. Corporations who want to create green tech might want to consider how much emissions and waste their products would indirectly create through data center servers they connect to, tech corporations in general and the government have a vested interest in making the economy grow through profit but also in reducing climate change (and not wasting resources in the midst of climate shocks). Plants and animals need clean water and suffer from climate change (natural habitats could be damaged to accommodate for this water usage and effluent waste water).  

### Connections to cerebellum-Inspired Circuits

Depending on the construction of these chips and how they engage with tech products/the internet, they'll be interacting with data centers, which could put additional strain on them. If ACC is connected to more AI products, that means more data centers are being built quickly to support AI specifically, and they'd be in on that big move which takes space, infrastructure, and resources from communities. 

### Similar cases

Industries that move into communities to create tech – like vehicles, maybe electrical vehicles specifically – create jobs, but also pollute the community and take resources. The logging industry is similar in that it takes a very precious natural resource that cannot be replenished quickly without that industry painstakingly assuring their natural resource use does not outstrip their replenishing of it ("water positive", like "carbon negative" is what all the industries are promising). NFTs and Cryptocurrency were also water and energy guzzlers when they were popular, and crypto is still taking a lot of resources within data centers. 

### Themes
Environmental Injustice, Political Economy (Labor), Nationalism (the AI-Race), business models 

### Precedence
Letting data centers spread at increasing rates to make up for the energy demand is setting a dangerous precedent when all countries are trying to reduce their carbon emissions and resource consumption.

## 2. The Democratic Republic of Congo
*Written by Tess Carter, August 2024*

### Summary
The Democratic Republic of the Congo is a natural resource rich land full of biodiversity and rare and important minerals like copper and cobalt (the focus of this case study), and it is also a land facing a very severe humanitarian crisis, because, despite being rich in resources, none of this wealth goes back into the DRC and Congolese people have to navigate life making less than $2 a day in dangerous conditions due to political instability, corruption, and military conflict. Places like North Kivu and Ituri are always being pushed for by armed groups clashing with military forces [[7]](https://phscharge.com/3541/opinion-features/unearthing-the-dark-side-of-cobalt-mining/).

Congolese people are facing physical and sexual violence, gender-based violence, displacement, abduction, and the killing thousands. Most of the population are deprived of their rights, many don't have access to adequate food, housing, clean water, electricity, and education and natural disasters are becoming more frequent with the uptake in climate change ([X](https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/drc/overview#:~:text=DRC%20is%20endowed%20with%20exceptional,not%20benefited%20from%20this%20wealth.)). On top of all of this foreign mining operations strip the DRC of its cobalt, a mineral critical to rechargeable devices and electric cars. Many Congolese people move to mining communities to become artisanal miners due to fewer job opportunities in the DRC at the moment. They illegally enter mines or create their own mining site to access deposits of cobalt and nickel. Buying from artisanal miners is illegal, but they still manage to produce more than 30% of the world's mined cobalt, and 70% of the all cobalt in production comes from the DRC at large [[3]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3bIzNX4co).

Major companies like Google, Microsoft, and Tesla rely on cobalt to stabilize their batteries, and get a majority of their cobalt from DRC because the quality of Congolese cobalt is far superior to other deposits worldwide. Due to the complexity of the supply chain that changes hands often,  Chinese buyers getting their cobalt from both legitimate and artisanal sellers and processing it all, and then selling it off again, many of these companies say they don't know exactly where their cobalt comes from. After the Amnesty Report in 2016, companies were pressured to make their supply chains more transparent so in 2019 many prominent companies came together in the DRC to support the tracing of cobalt by hiring due diligence companies to follow the trail of cobalt, map their supply chains and business relationships, and identify how these are linked to human rights abuses in the aim of mitigating risks/abuses to clean up mainly the child labor practices, often ignoring the environmental damages and other basic needs [[6]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2IW7UEclI).         

### Benefits

The cobalt that comes out of the DRC and other mines goes into devices like rechargeable phones, laptops, and cars – the electrical vehicle market seems to be entirely dependent on it – which allows us to have access to "greener" tech for a longer time and aids in other technological discoveries and in education. Cobalt can be recycled (and many countries are insisting companies begin using more recycled cobalts and materials in general so that the increasing demand for cobalt doesn't mean more mining) [[6]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2IW7UEclI)). Cobalt can even potentially be replaced in EV batteries by things like nickel, manganese, or iron based batteries, taking dependence off on this rare mineral [[2]](https://www.theecoexperts.co.uk/blog/alternatives-to-cobalt-mining)). Lithium-iron-phosphate is also an alternative, and the company Lamborghini has commissioned a research team to look into this cobalt-alternative [[1]](https://news.mit.edu/2024/cobalt-free-batteries-could-power-future-cars-0118)). Conceivably these mines *could* be very beneficial to Congolese communities by adding jobs and wealth back into the country, but as it is practiced now, the mining only harms the surrounding communities and benefits the international corporations who own the mining rights.      

### Harms 
* Lots of artisanal miners enter official mining areas illegally to access cobalt deposits and they have to work quickly because if the personal security or even presidential guardsmen sent by the Congolese government catch them the miners will be beaten and arrested [[3]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3bIzNX4co).     
* When a mine is established, the Congolese communities around the area are forced to move to make way for the mines to grow. The growth of the industrial-scale cobalt and copper mines in Lualaba specifically forced thousands out of their homes and farmlands, disrupting traditional practices and lifestyles [[4]](https://www.amnesty.org/en/location/africa/east-africa-the-horn-and-great-lakes/democratic-republic-of-the-congo/report-democratic-republic-of-the-congo/).    
* Once a mine is settled, there are hardly any safety protocols in place to protect workers or citizens in the area from the effect of cobalt exposure, and official mines do not protect the environment from cobalt and acidic poisoning though they are legally obligated to. Mines collapse frequently, there are landslides, people are buried alive because artisanal miners don't have the proper resources to secure their self-made mines even though their Chinese cooperatives in official mines profit from the mining [[3]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3bIzNX4co). When artisanally mined cobalt is brought to the market, foreign buyers manipulate the methods of measuring how much and what quality of cobalt the miners bring in to low-ball them, turning a 20 kilo bag into 10 kilos.    
* Miners and their helpers are constantly exposed to cobalt, which will poison them over time, increasing their risk of cancer. This is especially troubling because child-labor is used in abundance to mine cobalt artisanally. Families often don't have the choice but to have all their family members including their children help them find cobalt to get food on the table, leaving children to be exposed to dangerous mines, poisoning, and keeping them out of school.      
* Mining operations create a lot of pollution. Mining trucks dump waste into small hills. During the dry season, the mine tailings produce a toxic dust that drifts down from the hills and settles onto the fields, rendering them infertile and non-farmable for the most part. This dust also gets into the lungs of the surrounding community, worsening health outcomes. The water supply near mining communities is also poisoned by cobalt and lime (used as a precipitation agent for metals to keep the preferred pH balance) which they dump into the rivers haphazardly. It renders the drinking water undrinkable, poisoning the land further and leaving many communities without drinking water or even the ability to farm or forage for their own food as the animals can't survive long in these conditions either [[6]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2IW7UEclI).   
* These mines and ownership of them potentially fuel the violent conflicts already happening with the DRC    

### Who benefits?
Mining companies, buyers/refiners of cobalt, and the companies who buy the finished material benefit financially from this exchange, and by association everyone who owns an electric vehicle in the hopes of aiding the energy transition and being more green, and even anyone who owns an iphone or laptop filled with even a small percentage of the cobalt mined from the DRC. Cobalt obtained in this manner is often referred to as "blood minerals" for a reason.   

### Who is harmed?
Congolese citizens who do not see a drop of wealth returned in exchange for their exploited labor. From a larger point of view, all of us are harmed by: a green tech transition is fundamentally useless if thousands of people are exploited and suffer to produce this "better alternative". Cobalt mining also coincidentally makes around 1.6 million tonnes of carbon dioxide a year, ultimately fueling climate change even as cobalt is used for green alternatives which developed countries benefit from [[2]](https://www.theecoexperts.co.uk/blog/alternatives-to-cobalt-mining).  

### Stakeholders — direct and indirect

As many human-rights advocates before have said, if one group is not free then none of us are free. We all have a stake in human-rights abuses that supply the world with the material big tech uses to craft a technological future which we are paying money to make happen. It's imperative that more resources be put into cobalt-alternatives and into monitoring supply chains to stop blood minerals from coming into the market. Resources and aid needs to be provided to the communities in the DRC who have lost their natural environment and health to these mining operations.   

### Connections to Cerebellum-Inspired Circuits

Depending on the materials these circuits are made of, we may see similar abusive and exploitative mining practices to obtain these materials. Making the supply chain clear will be important for the production of cerebellum-inspired circuits, as well as how they are processed when they become e-waste.  

### Similar cases

Uranium mining in the US in Indigenous lands (often abandoned by the government without a proper clean-up) leaving the Indigenous people in the surrounding community with bad health outcomes and greater chances of cancer. lithium mining in Chile, Bolivia, and the US, just about any commercially large mining operations without proper oversight. Cobalt reserves have been found in Sweden, Norway, and Finland, and they have begun to see the environmental damage the DRC has from mining practices [[6]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2IW7UEclI).   

### Themes

Cultural imperialism, environmental justice, racial bias, business models  

### Precedence

Because these exploitive mining practices have been used for so long, it's not a big wonder that they might continue on in the future, especially with such complex supply lines, demand from the energy transfer, and the ideology of profit above all lurking. There are poorly run mines all over the world, and if we want to switch to cobalt-free batteries than we need to make sure the mines or labs creating these alternatives are completely ethical.    

### What can be done?
Aforementioned due-diligence companies are looking into supply lines, and it seems that the US Department of Labor's Bureau of International Affairs has an initiative called "combating child labor in the Democratic Republic of the Congo's Cobalt Industry" (COTECCO) which aimed to address child labor (go figure) through awareness and government enforcement. They worked with the DRC government in creating a interministerial commission in charge of monitoring child labor in artisanal mining, trained representatives in monitoring and remediation tools, asked companies to use a comply chain tool to look into their supply lines, and joined with the DRC government to make a Child Labor Monitoring Remediation System ([X](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ilab/combatting-child-labor-democratic-republic-congos-cobalt-industry-cotecco)). This is a step by the US to help stop child labor, but it doesn't address much more than that, and the last noted funding came in 2022\. It seems a lot more needs to be done by the DRC government and other countries who could provide aid in providing direct relief. Individually, we have the ability to boy-cott companies who use blood minerals to put pressure on them to change their ways, though finding out how much artisanal cobalt is used in any given product is very, very difficult.

## 3. Amazon Warehouse Automation ("Fulfillment Centers")

### Summary
Amazon is the biggest online shopping and shipping company in the world, employing over a million people providing the rest of us with smile-stamped packages only a few days after ordering. Amazon is always looking for ways to speed up your orders from production to warehouse to shipping, to make consumers happier and quarterly profits go up, and one way they achieve this is through automation. Robots of all kinds – from Sparrow, to Cardinal, to Proteus – hang out in Amazon warehouses, picking up and sorting packages, setting the pace for the human workers dashing around to select and haul back packages. A newer robot-model, Sequoia, identifies and stores inventory up to 75% faster than before and reduces the speed to process an order through a center by 25%, increasing shipping predictability and allowing for a boom in numbers of same-day or next-day goods. 

The newest prototype, Digit, is an anthropomorphic robot able to move while handling items and would help primarily with tote recycling [[2]](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/operations/amazon-introduces-new-robotics-solutions). Amazon views this shift into automation as both an efficiency gain, but also a safety gain for their workers who have less running around and grabbing to do when robots whisk items and pallets back and forth from dedicated "ergonomic workstations." Amazon and others also say, in response to fears about job losses from automation, that there may be losses in some job areas but more jobs opening in manufacturing and robotic maintenance [[3]](https://www.wired.com/story/amazons-new-robots-automation-revolution/). Regardless, Amazon is continuing to automate whatever processes they can within their warehouses to expedite their shipping-empire.      

### Benefits
Automated assistance like robots *can* make working conditions safer and less strenuous for human employees if utilized properly (with input from said employees on where automation would make the most sense), and it does affect the efficiency and speed of products being sent out, which customers are pleased with. Amazon investing in robots also has the benefit of creating new innovative robotics and similar technology which could inspire other robotics development labs. In all this robotics-innovation, people may not have to fear the loss of their jobs as much as they may now, as robots still have a long way to go before they can do the complex, dexterous tasks humans can, so human-robot collaboration is still as needed as human oversight in AI tasks.  

### Harms 
* Warehouse work does produce injuries which have to be reported to the federal government, and in 2022 Amazon employed 36% of all warehouse workers in the US and was responsible for 53% of all reported US warehouse injuries, and the year before that the Bureau of labor statistics found that Amazon's injury rate was 43% higher than the warehouse industry average [[4]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Il4c_snvLnQ).   
* Amazon has a a 100% turnover rates in warehouses (meaning more people than the amount of jobs available go through their employment in a year), which makes unionization attempts difficult as people who pledge to join the union will most likely be out within the year and new employees worry about job loss over pressing the issue of unionization, which they have a reason to be concerned over given Amazon's alleged union-busting tactics [[4]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Il4c_snvLnQ). The podcaster behind Megacorp, a podcast investigating the abuses of Amazon, took a look at the anti-union video that made its way around Whole Foods in 2018, which used wording like "not being anti-union, but not being neutral", and unions being against Amazon's goals of "speed and innovation" so any talk of activity that opposes those goals are dangerous for people's employment (an indirect threat if there ever was one). The video gives out tips for how to spot unionization-behavior from employee behavior, encouraging increased surveillance and interference. He also talked with labor reporter for Huffpost Dave Jameson who talked about deep-pocketed corporations like Amazon hiring anti-union consultants and power lawyers to stretch out the process of unionizing and throwing any wrench into said process as possible be it with challenging union elections or forcing employees into captive audience meetings to sow seeds of doubt about unions.    
* Amazon has a well-known history of mistreating employees by overworking them with long shifts of running up and down the length of a warehouse picking up a set number of packages of varying untenable weights each hour, with warnings, punishments, or termination for employees who fall behind on their quotas. This immense stress to keep up with the pace of work causes hundreds of injuries everyday, coming to a fever pitch during peak seasons like Prime Day. Prime Day comes with mandatory overtime, high speed, high volume work increases with little safety aids which produces injuries that workers don't get workers compensation for. There are concussions, slipped discs, sprained wrists, broken bones, bruising everywhere, crush injuries, and even overheating from the intense heat warehouses can get up to. Banners protesting this sport the words "same-day delivery, lifetime of injury" [[10]](https://www.vox.com/labor-jobs/361079/amazon-prime-day-labor-worker-injuries-union).   
* Injuries that happened on site are seen by AmCare, Amazon's health service. They prioritize Amazon's need to get employees back to work fast and to keep down their reported injury numbers, sending employees back out without proper treatment or referrals for lighter work [[4]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Il4c_snvLnQ).    
* During peak seasons there are floods of new employees who don't receive proper training, causing a bunch of new hires flooding in during peak seasons for Amazon, increasing injuries [[9]](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/17/tech/amazon-warehouses-prime-day-injuries-senate/index.html). There is a lot of machinery in Amazon warehouses that have the potential to harm, and there are doubts about whether employees are taught properly about how to use or act around them. In the Amazon: Behind the Smiles article, the tech Phillip Lee Terry was killed while servicing a forklift, and Amazon blamed Terry for "improper use" when there was no official documentation on hand of official training for this machine which they swore he had gone through [[8]](https://revealnews.org/behind-the-smiles-at-amazon/).     
* This is not helped by the increasing heat of Amazon warehouses and the lack of alleged lack of official training on certain machines which could cause accidents, nor the disrepaired clutter some shelves of merchandise can become which have the potential to drop on worker's heads.   
* Amazon has recently begun providing ergonomic workstations that fall in worker's "power zones" to reduce injury and have hired safety-conscious employees whose job it is to prevent injuries by ensuring ergonomic and physical therapy exercises, as well as encouraging breaks and stretching [[3]](https://www.wired.com/story/amazons-new-robots-automation-revolution/). This does not address the brutal, non-stop pace of work that the automation and robots in the Amazon warehouses enforce with their speed, and which the handheld devices or time-clocks on the walls remind the workers of constantly whenever they attempt to take a small unauthorized rest. Employees are surveilled constantly to make sure they are working and filling their quotas. The pace alongside robots who have the tendency of harming employees if not handled properly make work hellish. OSHA has not addressed the pace of work either, merely citing ergonomic hazards.   

### Who benefits?
Amazon executives should see an increase in profits and productivity if automation replaces or moves jobs in warehouses, or even if they conceivably do eventually reduce employee injuries. Customers receive packages quickly, which is good for consumer happiness and also important if said packages are vital. The field of robotics could certainly be aided by Amazon's feverish innovation of robots who can sort, walk, and carry.  

### Who is harmed?*
Amazon warehouse employees who suffer through minor to lifelong musculoskeletal ailments to keep up with the pace of work. Amazon executives seem willing to allow a rate of injury double the standard warehouse numbers because, as youtuber Logically Answered laid out, Jeff Bezos thinks entrenched workforces are a "march to mediocrity" and Amazon actually benefits more from churning through it's workforce rather than treating employees well to get them to stay, and they allegedly will create a toxic work environment to push employees out [[7]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdL85EP7s5M). This is unsustainable for both employees and Amazon in the long run when they run through the potential worldwide labor force available at the moment.  

### Stakeholders
Amazon executives who see automation as a potential solution for speedier work and faster profits without the need for more "human liability" and the workers who are directly affected and harmed by the pace of automation within Amazon warehouses. Indirectly, lots of people worldwide use Amazon to buy, sell, and ship their desired items, and we know that there are warehouse workers needlessly sacrificing their health to maintain this worldwide efficiency. As a speaker on the Reveal article "Amazon: Behind the Smiles" astutely put it, "...when you order something from Amazon and you've worked inside of Amazon, you wonder... is ordering my package going to be the demise of somebody?" [[8]](https://revealnews.org/behind-the-smiles-at-amazon/). If Amazon is willing to sacrifice worker health and attempt to stop unionization, many mega-corporations will (and have) follow suit, putting all laborers at risk, though the other side to forcefully automation implementation is that it may inspire workers to unionize, as Amazon's first US union on Staten Island rose up alongside Starbuck unionization protests.    

### Connections to Cerebellum-Inspired Circuits
These new circuits are expected to make an impact in robotics and cybersecurity with their potential improved anomaly detection capabilities, which means this tech could find a market within Amazon's robotics team. It's important to consider how these circuits will both improve robotic performance and how they might make human labor easier or more difficult. It's also important to consider the larger effect of ACC on labor in general if it's implemented more widely in AI, algorithms, or automation.

### Themes
Control/surveillance, labor, business models 

### Precedence
The successful unionization efforts of many Amazon warehouses is sending a strong message to Amazon and other corporations who use exploitative methods that union-busting will no longer be tolerated, and will encourage further unionization attempts in other industries as well.  

### What can be done?
Beginning in 2023 the US Federal trade Commission along with 17 other state attorney generals have started a suit against Amazon for alleged monopolist strategies, such as stopping rivals and smaller sellers from lowering their prices, degrading shopping and material quality for consumers, overcharging sellers, suppressing innovation, and stopping rivals from having a fair competition with Amazon through these tactics. They're calling for an injunction in federal court to prohibit Amazon from taking such negative actions, which could be a step towards breaking Amazon up entirely [[11]](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/09/ftc-sues-amazon-illegally-maintaining-monopoly-power). 

Likewise, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has been issuing citations for hazardous workplace environments at Amazon warehouses for a while now, continuing to find ergonomic hazards in many of the warehouses they do surprise inspections of, and concern over the very high on-site injury logs. Their citation fees continue to not be effective since asking for $46,875 from a trillion dollar company isn't going to have a humongous effect even if many of their warehouses are cited, and there have been instances where OSHA investigators like John Stallone of Indiana have been pressured or threatened to back down on citing Amazon for workplace safety violations, with Stallone even being confront by Indiana's labor commissioner and governor who insisted he drop the case so they could establish a deal for a second Amazon headquarter in Indiana [[8]](https://revealnews.org/behind-the-smiles-at-amazon/). State governments may try to overlook many violations in the attempt to bring more jobs and wealth into their state, but at least these governmental actions are an increased effort regardless, which will draw further federal government attention. 

In France, Amazon was fined for their surveillance of their workers through their handheld devices which breached the General Data Protection Regulations of France, signaling when workers scanned too quickly or too slowly, or whether they went over their break or even took a break, and all this information was stored for more than 31 days without employee knowledge [[3]](https://www.wired.com/story/amazons-new-robots-automation-revolution/). All this to say that government interference is happening alongside unionization (attempts which the government has supported by forcing Amazon to redo union elections they allegedly tampered with). There is also, in the realm of design theory, the concept of participatory design, wherein the people who are being designed items/tools have input in the design to fit better to their needs. In the case of Amazon participatory design could be used in warehouses to see what employees want to be automated and what would make their jobs much easier and safer rather than having Amazon shove a new robot into their workplace which takes a specific job and increases stress for other jobs.
