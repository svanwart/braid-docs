Introduction to Binary numbers

## 1. What is Binary?
As we learned in the previous sections, computers use a series of switches to represent information and perform computations. This means that computers require that data and instructions be encoded in terms of switches, where 1 symbolizes "on" and 0 symbolizes "off."

{% light-switch value=1 /%}

That's all that binary is --  idea of binary. For a computer to be able to process and store information, it needs to be encoded into a form that a computer understands: a series of 1s and 0s. For this to be possible, humans have invented different systems of encodings to translate different types of information into binary[1]. 

        {% light-switches values=[1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0] /%}


In this section we'll be focusing on how to represent and manipulate numbers using binary. 

## 2. Converting Between Decimal and Binary

### Representing ideas in binary
Just a few examples of how you can use binary to represent letters, colors, and more.

## Footnotes
[1] Each kind of data can have it's own way of representing information in binary. For instance, letters might use a system called [ASCII](#) or [UTF8](#), and images might use something called a [bitmap](#) -- more on that later.
