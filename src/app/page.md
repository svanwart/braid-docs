## 2. Algorithms and Machine Learning

{% card title="To make sense of it at scale, we need smart AI & ML approaches" %}
* Bullet Point 1
* Bullet Point 2
* Bullet Point 3

## 3. Hardware Limitations at Scale
{% card title="Current computers are energy inefficient" %}
* Von Neumann bottleneck
* At scale, this is problematic (data centers)

## 4. Taking Inspiration from the Brain
{% card title="Can we take inspiration from the brain to improve efficiency?" %}
* Neuromorphic computing promises greater efficiency
* Bullet Point 2
* Bullet Point 3

## 5. Taking inspiration from the Cerebellum
{% card title="How can cerebellum-inspired circuits help?" %}
* The cerebellum (an efficient sensorimotor integrator)
* By understanding how it ignores only the most essential of signals (data from the environment), the cerebellum...

## 6. Potential Benefits
{% card title="What benefits could cerebellum-inspired circuits provide?" %}
* Energy efficiency
* Data efficiency
* New kinds of capabilitiess: being able to recognize outliers (versus putting information into existing categories)
