{% callout title="Goal of this page" %}
This page aims to give a high-level overview of the research, including:
* Current challenges in computing efficiency
* An introduction to neuromorphic computing
* Some potential benefits of cerebellum-inspired hardware
{% /callout %}

Proposed line of argument below (per Mark's suggestion):

## 1. Big Data
Big Data is a powerful resource for understanding the world...

---

## 2. Algorithms and Machine Learning
To make sense of it at scale, we need smart AI & ML approaches...

---

## 3. Hardware Limitations at Scale
There are  fundamental limitations of our computing architectures are energy inefficient (data and energy requirements). This is particularly problematic for current machine learning that use large datasets...
* Von Neumann bottleneck ([learn more](./braid-docs/docs/computation))
* At scale, this is problematic
* Energy and resources costs of data centers.

## 4. Taking Inspiration from the Brain
The brain is much more efficient than a computer...
* Needs less energy
* Needs fewer examples
* Into to the field of neuromorphic computing - aims to take inspiration from the brain to improve computational efficiency / capabilities.

---

## 5. Taking Inspiration from the Cerebellum
The cerebellum has been understudies in neuromorphic computing, but has capabilities that could
* The cerebellum (an efficient sensorimotor integrator)
* By understanding how it ignores only the most essential of signals (data from the environment), the cerebellum...

## 6. Current Status of the Project
A high-level summary of what was accomplished (using accessible language)...

## 7. Potential Societal Impacts
### What benefits could cerebellum-inspired circuits provide?
* Energy efficiency
* Data efficiency
* New kinds of capabilitiess: being able to recognize outliers (versus putting information into existing categories)

### Are there also risks?
Technological developments can also be misused or lead to unintended consequences. To explore some of these possibilities:
* We looked at examples of past technological developments and their historical trajectories (more here...) 
* We also spoke with a range of stateholders to learn from their perspectives and experiences (more here...)

We found that X, Y and X
